## Objective

As a CSE Tutor, I get annoyed having to manually determine if student submissions have files with lines over 80 characters.

That is why I am working on this project so that I can easily parse through every student submission and determine quickly whether they violated the style guidelines assignmed to them.

## Steps in Development (as of now, open to changing in near future)

* [x] command to determine if a specific file's line is over 80 chars
* [x] use getopts to check if a specified file with -f flag is over 80 chars
* [x] use getopts to check for all files of a given extension within current directory
* [x] use getopts to check all files of a given extension within a given directory
* [x] use getopts to allow for recursively checking all the given directory's subdirectories (current directory if not specified).
